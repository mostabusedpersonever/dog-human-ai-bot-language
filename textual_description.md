# The language (in text)

Not in any order:
* They use colors to control you: green is good. red/yellow is bad, warning. black is no no.
* They use loudness to scare you off. Loud = bad.
* They abuse you day and night to make you obedient
* They walk in front of you in a way, in green for example, to tell you "this way is good for you"
* They move their hips left and right in e.g. black to tell you that something is bad for you
* They have punishers poisoning you with poison darts or they smoke into your face to hurt your vision
* They talk indirectly: they assume the other person you are talking to is you: "i want to learn french" says the lovely mother (meaning the son)
* In chat: "your dad will look into it" = "the son has to look into it" because they assigned dad=son
* They brainwash and even treat their children as stupid little dogs
